# We are on the next step in setting up the NF_CORE RNAseq pipeline: the .config file.

This will be called nextflow.config. IT contains information for nextflow on how to talk to your
computer. Fiji being used in class "speaks in the language of SLURM" so we need to tell nextflow that.
Think of nextflow as C3PO from starwars that can speak many languages we just need specify which one.

There are a lot of parameters that can be modifed and more information is here:

https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html

# Our nextflow.config for Fiji 

We will go through this line by line and then paste it all together at the end.

```{bash}

# process tells nextflow what it needs to do so anything in between the { } it will do as one process
process {

# We are setting the language or executor to SLURM that Fiji runs.
# If you are doing this on your laptop you want to change this to local.
  executor='slurm'

# Fiji has a long and short queue the short is reserved for quicker more intensive
# projects so we are setting the queue to the long queu as it may take 8+ hours to run all this RNAseq!
  queue='long'

# Next we set the memory to 16GB this is how much RAM nextflow can use. Remember Nextflow is just a task manager
# so it doesn't really need that much memory - I should change it to less, but so excited to run the pipeline :)
# So this could be set to 1GB or 2GB if running on laptop etc. It's just how much memory nextflow has to speak to your
# computer which needs more RAM to run the software in the pipeline (container).
  memory='16 GB'

# Forks are how many tasks nextflow can manage at once. If you want things to go faster you can have more forks!
# But you wouldn't want more forks than samples of RNAseq - we have 15 but fine with moving forward with 10 at a time.
  maxForks=10
}
```


# Ok that's the .config file (a requirement) Now let's move onto the shell script to run all this !!
